# Amazon-Clone (Click here for Demo - https://developeratharva.github.io/Amazon-Clone/)

This project is a simplified Amazon clone developed as part of my JavaScript learning journey. The primary focus was to implement JavaScript to make the site fully interactive.

Please note that I did not build the HTML and CSS components of this project; my role was solely to work on the JavaScript functionality. This project allowed me to practice and enhance my skills in creating dynamic and interactive web applications.
